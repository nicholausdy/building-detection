# building-detection
Comparison of loss functions in UNet for building detection in remote sensing images.

Six loss functions are compared with one another using Intersection over Union (IoU) as the evaluation metric.
1. Binary Cross Entropy with Logits (BCE-Logits) Loss
2. Dice-Sorensen Coefficient (DSC) Loss
3. BCE-Dice Loss
4. Intersection over Union (IoU) Loss
5. Focal Loss
6. Tversky Loss

Written for Remote Sensing Image Analysis course in The University of Tokyo.
